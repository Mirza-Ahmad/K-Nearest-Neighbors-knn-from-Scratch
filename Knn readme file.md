# Geometric Intuition of KNearest Neighbors(KNN)

***K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** is a simple yet powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It's an instance-based learning algorithm, meaning that it makes predictions based on the similarity of data points in the training dataset. KNN classifies a data point by finding the k nearest neighbors from the training data and assigning the majority class label among those neighbors to the query point. For regression tasks, it can predict the average value of the k nearest neighbors.*

 *****Why KNN is Considered a Lazy Algorithm* ?****
*The main reason is that it doesn't really "learn" during the training phase. Instead, it memorizes the entire training dataset. The training phase in KNN simply involves storing the data points and their corresponding labels. There is no explicit model-building process that extracts patterns or relationships from the data.*
*The ***"laziness"*** of KNN becomes evident during the prediction phase:*

 **1.**  ***No Model Building:*** Unlike other algorithms that build models during training, KNN doesn't generate a model based on the training data.
 
**2.**  ***Instance-Based Prediction:*** When you want to predict the class of a new data point, KNN doesn't make any generalizations or learn from the training data. Instead, it searches the training data for the k-nearest neighbors to the new point and uses the majority class among those neighbors to make a prediction.

**3.** ***Computation on Demand:*** KNN performs computations only when needed, i.e., when a prediction is requested. It calculates distances between the new point and all other points in the training data to find the nearest neighbors.

***How to Select the Value of K in KNN ?***
*Selecting the right value of k is crucial in KNN, as it can significantly impact the algorithm's performance. A smaller value of k can lead to more noise affecting predictions, while a larger value of k can result in smoother decision boundaries but may lead to overgeneralization. The process of selecting the optimal k value is known as **hyperparameter tuning**.*
*Here's a brief overview of how to select the value of k:*

 **1.** ***Odd vs. Even K Values:** Choose an odd value for k to avoid ties when there's an equal number of neighbors for different classes. This helps to avoid confusion in classifying query points.* 
 
 **2.** ***Cross-Validation:*** *Divide your dataset into a training set and a validation set (or use techniques like k-fold cross-validation). Train the KNN model with different values of k and measure its performance on the validation set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.*
 
  **3.** ***Experimentation:*** *Test different k values and observe how the model performs. Try to strike a balance between bias and variance. A lower k may lead to higher variance, while a higher k may lead to higher bias.*
  
    # Experimentation Technique
    scores= [] 
    choose_k=  16
    for i in  range(1, choose_k):
    knn= KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=i)
    knn.fit(X_train_tranform, Y_train)
    y_pred= knn.predict(X_test_transform)
    score= accuracy_score(Y_test, y_pred)
    scores.append(score)

## ***Discuss some scenarios where knn might not be the best choice***

*The k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm is versatile and can be used in various scenarios, particularly when the nature of your data and problem align with its strengths. Here are some situations where k-NN might not be a good choice:*

 **-** ***Large Datasets:*** As the number of data points grows, the computational cost of calculating distances for prediction becomes significant.
 
 **-** ***High-Dimensional Data:*** *In high-dimensional spaces, the concept of "nearest" neighbors becomes less meaningful, often leading to the "curse of dimensionality" where distances between points become similar, making predictions less reliable.*
 
 **-**  ***Imbalanced Classes:*** *In datasets with imbalanced classes, k-NN might be biased towards the majority class since it considers the majority of neighbors.*

 **-** ***Sensitive to Noise:*** *While k-NN can be robust to small amounts of noise, significant noise can lead to incorrect predictions.*
 
 **-** ***Parameter Selection:*** *Choosing the right value of k can be crucial. If k is too small, ]the algorithm might be sensitive to individual data points; if it's too large, it could lead to overgeneralization.*
